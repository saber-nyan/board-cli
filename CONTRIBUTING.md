# Contribute?!
Yep.<br/>
Who cares? Nobody cares. But...

1. I recommend using the best open-source Java IDE ― IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Check the code with the analyzer. The project has a built-in profile (for IDEA) `More strict` ― use it.
3. Test your changes! At least try to compile them.
4. Document your code with `javadoc`. Please.
5. Describe your changes. Sometimes I'm too lazy to read tons of code.
6. ?????
7. **Fork -> Commit -> Push -> Pull request!**

*Thanks.*
