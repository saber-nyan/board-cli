Yep.<br/>
Who cares? Nobody cares. But...

1. I recommend using the best open-source Java IDE ― IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Use `@Nullable`/`@NotNull` annotations, include in `build.gradle`: `compile 'com.intellij:annotations:12.0'`.
3. Check the code with the analyzer. The project has a built-in profile (for IDEA) `More strict` ― use it.
4. Test your changes! At least try to compile them.
5. Write unit tests (`junit:4.12` is already included in the build config) ― a useful thing!
6. Document your code with `javadoc`. Please.
7. Describe your changes. %%Sometimes I'm too lazy to read tons of code.%%
8. ?????
9. **Fork -> Commit -> Push -> Pull request!**

*Thanks.*
